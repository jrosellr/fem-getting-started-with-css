# Frontend Masters Course: Getting Started with CSS
This repo holds the final project I built for Jen Kramer's course 'Getting Started with CSS' on the platform Frontend Masters.

## Technologies
In this project I practiced the following technologies:
  - HTML 5
  - CSS
  - CSS Grid
  - CSS Flexbox

## Next Steps
Some next steps I could take:
  - [ ] Deploy this website using GitHub Pages
  - [ ] Improve the mobile layout navbar
  - [ ] Use a CSS preprocessor (Sass probably)
